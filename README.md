Custom Authorization Server OAuth + JWT Token Provider
======================================================

This is a simple library that provides the framework for a custom OAuth 2.x server to be used as an OAuthProvider in ASP.NET MVC.

It is designed to work with any OAuth Server, and is *based* on the work done for the Amazon-OAuth-Provider by the good folk at http://freebusy.io.

Amazon-OAuth-Provider
======================

Amazon.com offers "Login with Amazon" service which supports authentication and authorization using OAuth2. 

ASP.NET MVC 5 Web apps that use ASP.NET Identity 2.0 with OWIN as described at 
http://www.asp.net/identity can use "Login with Amazon" for user identity and sign in.

This library was originally developed for and is in use at https://freebusy.io
